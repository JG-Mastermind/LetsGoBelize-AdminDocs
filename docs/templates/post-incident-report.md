## üìù **Executive Summary**

**[Write 3-5 sentences for non-technical stakeholders]**

Example:
> On October 8, 2025, between 2:15 PM and 4:30 PM BZT, the LetsGoBelize.app booking system experienced a complete outage affecting all customers attempting to book tours. The incident was caused by a database migration that introduced a schema conflict with the booking API. The engineering team rolled back the migration and restored full service within 2 hours and 15 minutes. Approximately 47 customers were impacted, resulting in an estimated $3,200 in lost bookings. All affected customers were notified and offered 10% discount codes for future bookings.

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **What Happened:**
[Detailed technical explanation of the incident]

Example:
> A database migration (migration #20251008_141000) added a new NOT NULL column `tour_availability` to the `bookings` table without providing a default value. The booking API immediately began failing when attempting INSERT operations because it did not include this new required column in its queries. The migration script passed all pre-deployment tests in staging because staging data already had values for this column (manually populated during testing), masking the production issue.

---

### **Why It Happened:**
[Root cause - not just proximate cause]

Example:
> **Immediate Cause:** Missing default value in schema migration.
>
> **Contributing Factors:**
> 1. Staging environment data was manually modified, creating a mismatch with production
> 2. Migration lacked a two-phase deployment (add column with default ‚Üí populate data ‚Üí make NOT NULL)
> 3. Booking API integration tests did not cover newly added columns
> 4. No pre-deployment validation against production schema snapshot
>
> **Root Cause:** Inadequate testing procedures for database schema changes affecting critical APIs.

---

### **Why It Wasn't Detected Earlier:**
[Gaps in monitoring, testing, or processes]

Example:
> - Staging environment diverged from production (manual data changes)
> - Integration tests used mocked database responses (did not hit real schema)
> - No automated schema diff comparison between staging and production
> - Monitoring alerts configured for 500 errors only (booking failures returned 400 Bad Request)

---

## üìä **Impact Assessment**

### **Users Affected:**
- **Total Users:** 47 customers
- **User Types:** Travelers attempting to book tours
- **Geographic Distribution:** 35 USA, 8 Canada, 4 UK
- **Critical Users:** 2 VIP corporate partners (contacted directly)

---

### **Systems Affected:**
- **Primary:** Booking API (complete outage)
- **Secondary:** Admin Dashboard booking module (manual bookings failed)
- **Unaffected:** Website browsing, tour pages, user logins, AI Concierge

---

### **Data Affected:**
- **Data Loss:** None (no bookings were corrupted or deleted)
- **Data Exposure:** None (no security breach)
- **Orphaned Transactions:** 12 incomplete Stripe payment intents (refunded automatically)

---

### **Revenue Impact:**
- **Lost Bookings:** 47 customers √ó avg $68/booking = ~$3,200 lost revenue (estimated)
- **Refunds Issued:** $0 (no completed bookings during outage)
- **Discount Codes Issued:** 47 √ó 10% = potential $320 revenue reduction on future bookings
- **Total Estimated Loss:** $3,520

---

### **Reputational Impact:**
- **Customer Complaints:** 8 emails, 3 social media mentions
- **Media Coverage:** None
- **Review Impact:** 1 negative Google review citing "website broken"
- **Trust Score:** Monitoring for drop in conversion rates (review in 7 days)

---

## üèÜ **What Went Well**

1. **Fast Detection:** Incident detected within 5 minutes of first failure
2. **Clear Communication:** Incident Commander kept team informed via Slack war room
3. **Quick Rollback:** Engineering team executed rollback in 7 minutes (within target)
4. **Customer Outreach:** All affected customers notified within 1 hour of resolution
5. **Coordination:** Operations, engineering, and support teams collaborated effectively

---

## üö® **What Went Poorly**

1. **Inadequate Testing:** Migration tested in non-representative staging environment
2. **Delayed Escalation:** Initial P1 classification delayed P0 response by 10 minutes
3. **Manual Monitoring:** Relied on customer reports instead of automated error alerts
4. **Documentation Gap:** No runbook for database migration rollback procedures
5. **Recovery Time:** 2h 15m exceeded our 1-hour RTO target for critical systems

## üí° **Lessons Learned**

### **Process Improvements:**
1. **Two-Phase Schema Changes:** All NOT NULL column additions must follow add-with-default ‚Üí populate ‚Üí enforce pattern
2. **Staging Parity:** Automated weekly refresh of staging data from production
3. **Pre-Deployment Validation:** Schema diff review mandatory for all database changes

---

### **Technical Improvements:**
1. **Monitoring Gaps:** Expand error alerting beyond 500 errors to include 400 Bad Request
2. **Integration Testing:** Use real database (not mocks) in critical API tests
3. **Automated Rollback:** Implement one-click rollback for database migrations

---

### **Communication Improvements:**
1. **Severity Escalation:** Update severity classification guide to escalate faster
2. **Customer Notifications:** Pre-draft incident notification templates for common scenarios
3. **Status Page:** Implement public status page (status.letsgobelize.app) for transparency

---

## üîí **Security Considerations**

### **Was this a security incident?**
‚òê Yes  ‚òë No
