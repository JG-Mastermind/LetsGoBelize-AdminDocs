   - [ ] Check weather conditions (if outdoor activity)
   - [ ] Confirm meeting point logistics
   - [ ] Note any special requests (dietary, mobility)

**Red Flags:**
- No guide confirmation by 2 hours before tour ‚Üí Call guide directly
- Severe weather warning ‚Üí Contact guide about cancellation
- Customer no-show ‚Üí Wait 30 min past meeting time, then mark as "customer_no_show"

---

#### **Step 3: Send Confirmation Reminders**

For tours happening **tomorrow**:

1. Dashboard ‚Üí **"Bookings"** ‚Üí Filter: **"Tour Date = Tomorrow"** + **"Confirmed"**
2. System auto-sends WhatsApp reminder at 4 PM (verify in Logs)
3. Manually check:
   - [ ] WhatsApp delivery status = "delivered" (green checkmark)

üí° **Tip:** 80% of no-shows are prevented by 24-hour reminders.

### **Partial Refund Example**

**Calculation:**
- Original payment: $300.00
- Refund policy: 50% (7-14 days window)
- Refund amount: $150.00
- Customer keeps: $150.00 (covers guide's time, admin costs)

**Important:** Explain to customer via email:
```
Hi [Customer Name],

Your cancellation falls within our 7-14 day window, which qualifies for a 50% refund per our policy.

Refund amount: $150.00 (will appear in 5-10 business days)
Non-refundable amount: $150.00 (covers guide preparation and admin costs)

Thank you for understanding. We'd love to welcome you on a future adventure!

## üîÑ **Manual Overrides (Use with Caution)**

### **When Manual Intervention Required**

1. **Availability Override**
   - **Scenario:** Customer wants to book tour that shows "sold out"
   - **Reason:** Guide confirmed they can take 1 more person
   - **Action:** Admin increases `max_participants` by 1 for that date
   - **Risk:** Tour quality may suffer if too crowded

2. **Price Override**
   - **Scenario:** VIP customer negotiated discounted rate
   - **Reason:** Corporate partnership, repeat customer loyalty
   - **Action:** Admin creates booking with custom price
   - **Risk:** Revenue loss, other customers may request same discount

3. **Date Change Without Penalty**
   - **Scenario:** Customer needs to reschedule due to emergency
   - **Reason:** Compassionate exception (e.g., family medical emergency)
   - **Action:** Admin transfers booking to new date, waives change fee
   - **Risk:** Sets precedent, others may request same

‚ö†Ô∏è **Approval Required:** All manual overrides require super admin written approval via email.

---

### **Override Procedure**

1. Customer requests exception ‚Üí Document in writing (email/ticket)
2. Admin evaluates request ‚Üí Check refund policy, guide availability
3. Request super admin approval ‚Üí Forward customer email + recommendation
4. If approved:
   - Admin processes override in dashboard
   - Add detailed note to booking: "Exception granted by [Super Admin Name] on [Date] - Reason: [Justification]"
   - Log in monthly audit report
5. If denied:
   - Politely explain policy to customer
   - Offer alternative (e.g., credit toward future booking)

üí° **Audit Trail:** All overrides are logged and reviewed quarterly.
