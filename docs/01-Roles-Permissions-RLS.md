## üîí **Platform Security Overview**

### **How Data Protection Works**

The platform automatically enforces data access rules based on your role:
- Guides see only **their** tours and bookings
- Admins can view all operational data
- Travelers can only access their own bookings and profile
- Security rules are managed by the engineering team

### **What This Means for You**

When you log in, the system automatically:
- Shows you only the data you're authorized to see
- Prevents accidental access to restricted information
- Blocks unauthorized modifications
- Enforces role-based rules consistently

**Example**: A guide viewing bookings will only see bookings for their own tours, even if they try to access other data.

üí° **Key Takeaway:** Security policies are configured by the engineering team and cannot be changed from the dashboard.

---

## üö® **ESCALATION GUIDE**

### **When to Escalate**

| **Scenario**                                  | **Contact**                      | **Response Time** |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| "Access Denied" error for authorized action   | hello@letsgobelize.app           | 2 hours           |
| Need to change a user's role                  | Super admin via email            | 24 hours          |
| Suspected security breach (unauthorized access)| security@letsgobelize.app        | 15 minutes        |
| security policy blocking legitimate work           | engineering@letsgobelize.app     | 48 hours          |

## üìö **Examples & Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Guide Can't See Booking**

**Problem:** Guide reports they can't see a booking for their tour.

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Verify the booking exists (admin checks `bookings` table)
2. Confirm booking's `guide_id` matches the guide's `user_id`
3. Check security policy `guides_read_own_bookings` is active
4. If data mismatch: Update booking's `guide_id` (admin action)

**Root Cause:** Usually a data entry error where booking was created without proper `guide_id` reference.

---

### **Scenario 2: Admin Can't Edit User Role**

**Problem:** Admin tries to promote a guide to admin but gets "Permission Denied."

**Expected Behavior:** Only super admins can change roles (security audit requirement from August 23, 2025).

**Solution:**
1. Admin emails super admin with request
2. Super admin verifies request is legitimate
3. Super admin updates role via User Management page
4. System sends audit log entry

**Why:** Role changes are high-risk. Centralized control prevents privilege escalation attacks.

---

### **Scenario 3: Blogger Sees "Insufficient Permissions"**

**Problem:** Blogger tries to edit another blogger's post.

**Expected Behavior:** security policy `bloggers_update_own_posts` restricts updates to posts where `author_id = user.id`.

**Solution:**
1. Verify blogger is trying to edit someone else's post
2. If legitimate need: Contact admin to edit post
3. If unauthorized: Remind blogger of role boundaries

**Why:** Content ownership prevents accidental overwrites.
